CODE PRACTICE-TUESDAY

Video Compiling vs interpreting

Nowadays modern day computing programmers has many different choices of programming languages, choosing a language depends on what plarforms are going to be used. Web, desktop, mobile, game, etc.

Another factor is that particular language is usually compiled or interpreted

For example every code is reade and converted to binary machine code.

In the compile code the entire program source code is converted first before any computer runs it.

In the interpeted code, it goes through one line at a time, converting each line to its binary equivalent.

Compilation

Pros	        Con
Fast	        Not cross-platform
Source code private	Requires extra compiling step

Interpretation

Pro	Con
Cross platform	Slower
No extra step or faster debuggin	Public source code

Typically compiled languages

C, C++, objective C

Typically Interpreted languages

PHP, Javascript, Java, C#, Python

Java language is compiled o interpreted?

Java can be considered both, a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software -based interpreter.

Algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currency to USD

1-Start
2-Define the amount of Quetzales to exchange for US dollars 
3-Consider the value 1 USD = 7.80 Quetzales
4-Amount of quetzales divided the amount of US dollar
5-read the amount exchanged
6-Finish

Why is pseudocode helpful?

Is a great way to start on programming because we donÂ´t have to learn coding syntax, the mistakes are seen very quickly before we start any code.

Aproximated age on pseudocode:

1-Start
2-Year of born
3-Actual year=2022
4-Actual age= Actual year minus year of born
5-show actual age

Flowcharts

Flowcharts are tools very helpful to separate and follow a sequential order of any process.

High-level and low-level languages

The main difference between is that the programmer can easily understand the lines of source code, on his common language, most part of time, written in english and then the compiler or interpreter transalates to binary code.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73202651/149052007-e554a52a-7fe8-41fe-b447-a80e0e3b699f.png)
