CODE PRACTICE-TUESDAY

Video Compiling vs interpreting

Nowadays modern day computing programmers has many different choices of programming languages, choosing a language depends on what plarforms are going to be used. Web, desktop, mobile, game, etc.

Another factor is that particular language is usually compiled or interpreted

For example every code is reade and converted to binary machine code.

In the compile code the entire program source code is converted first before any computer runs it.

In the interpeted code, it goes through one line at a time, converting each line to its binary equivalent.

Compilation

Pros	        Con
Fast	        Not cross-platform
Source code private	Requires extra compiling step

Interpretation

Pro	Con
Cross platform	Slower
No extra step or faster debuggin	Public source code

Typically compiled languages

C, C++, objective C

Typically Interpreted languages

PHP, Javascript, Java, C#, Python

Java language is compiled o interpreted?

Java can be considered both, a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software -based interpreter.

Algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currency to USD

1-Start
2-Define the amount of Quetzales to exchange for US dollars 
3-Consider the value 1 USD = 7.80 Quetzales
4-Amount of quetzales divided the amount of US dollar
5-read the amount exchanged
6-Finish

Why is pseudocode helpful?

Is a great way to start on programming because we donÂ´t have to learn coding syntax, the mistakes are seen very quickly before we start any code.

Aproximated age on pseudocode:

1-Start
2-Year of born
3-Actual year=2022
4-Actual age= Actual year minus year of born
5-show actual age

Flowcharts

Flowcharts are tools very helpful to separate and follow a sequential order of any process.

High-level and low-level languages

The main difference between is that the programmer can easily understand the lines of source code, on his common language, most part of time, written in english and then the compiler or interpreter transalates to binary code.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73202651/149052007-e554a52a-7fe8-41fe-b447-a80e0e3b699f.png)

BINARY AND HEXADECIMAL


Binary is a base-2 number system that is made up only for two numbers or digits "zero" and "one" this is the base of any computer processsor, thats the way the processor reads instructions, any zero means off, and any number one means on.

Hexadecimal number system is a type of system that has a base on 16 symbols, these symbols or values are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F this sistem is used to simplify how binary instructions are represented.


MY DATE OF BIRTH IN BINARY

First, we took the number 1988, we must divide the number by 2, each time we divide by 2 and the results gives us a 1 remainder we will take it like a "0" and if the remainder give us a "1" must be taken as "1"

1988/2 =994 =     0
994/2   =497 =     1
497/2   =248.5 =  1
248/2  = 124 =     1
124/2 = 62 =        1
62/2=31 =            1
31/2=15.5 =         0
15/2=7.5 =           0
7.5/2=3.75           0
3/2=1.5                 1
1/2=0.5                 0
0.5/2=0.25           0

On Hexadecimal we must guide by a table that gives a value to each 4 binary numbers

 

So the number 011111000100 in hexadecimal representation must be shown: 7C4

TRANSLATE 51966 INTO HEXADECIMAL AND BINARY

TO TRANSLATE INTO BINARY

We must read the instruction shown before, divide the hole number by 2 and following the instruction must result

1100101011111110

In HEXADECIMAL following the table of equal values will give

1110=c
1010=a
1111=f
1110=e

THURSDAY CHALLENGE

APPLICATIONS ON BUILT ON JAVASCRIPT

by 2014 Nextflix was built on javascript for the font-end and the back-end was handled by a large running groovy scripts, this forced developers to use different programming languages, Node.js eliminated this problem, by using Javascript framework on the front-end and back-end, developers reduced their workload and increased the quality of the final web application. 

Candy crush saga is one of the most successful video games of all time realeased as a facebook web app, the free to play game developed on javascript programming languate, the flexible nature of this framework enabled developers to create this mobile app.

facebook continues like one of the most important corporate suporters of the javascript development library. This is the reason why react was developed by facebook on 2015

linkedin uses javascript for the front-end and back-end
